# LLM-driven NPC agent for Minecraft
This project adds NPCs that players can control and interact with using natural language.  
Built on Minecraft modding tools (NeoForge) with NLP integration.  
Goal: create more immersive and dynamic player–NPC interactions.  
Work in progress – contributions and ideas welcome!
